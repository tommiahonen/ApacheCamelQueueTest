== ActiveMQ and Files example

=== Introduction

This example shows how to work with files and ActiveMQ queues.

It reads files from a folder and writes them to a queue.

=== Prerequisites

First make sure ActiveMQ server is up and running. If not, you can start it from the terminal: `docker-compose up -d`.

After that open http://localhost:8161/admin/queues.jsp in browser (username=_admin_, password=_admin_) and create a queue with the name _replyTo_.

=== Build

You will need to compile this example first:

[source,sh]
----
$ mvn compile
----

=== Run

The example should run if you type

[source,sh]
----
$ mvn exec:java
----

After the example is complete, you should see 9 new pending messages in queue _replyTo_ at http://localhost:8161/admin/queues.jsp.
